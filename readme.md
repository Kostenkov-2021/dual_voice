# Dual Voice for NVDA #

Dual voice is an addon that made possible use of two different voices (currently both voices must support SAPI5 standard) for reading two languages one with Latin script and another with non-Latin writing script. For example, a user can select a voice for reading English as a language with the Latin writing script and select a voice for reading Persian (my language) as a language with the non-Latin writing script. 
Languages with the Latin writing script are English, Czech, Croatian, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Slovenian, Spanish, and Turkish.
Languages with the non-Latin script are Persian, Arabic, Belarusian, Bulgarian, Chinese, Greek, Hebrew, Japanese, Korean, Russian, and Ukrainian.
