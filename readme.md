# Dual Voice for NVDA #

Dual voice is an addon that made possible use of two different voices (currently both voices must support SAPI5 standard) for reading two languages one with Latin script and another with non-Latin writing script. For example, a user can select a voice for reading English as a language with the Latin writing script and select a voice for reading Persian (my language) as a language with the non-Latin writing script. 
Some of the languages with the Latin writing script are English, Spanish, German, French, Italian, Dutch, and Turkish. 
Some the languages with the non-Latin script are Arabic, Chinese, Russian, Hebrew, Japanese, Korean, and Persian.

You can download the [latest version of the Dual Voice for NVDA](https://github.com/Mahmood-Taghavi/dual_voice/releases/download/v4.7/dual_voice-4.7.nvda-addon)

Note: You can now use a custom dialog box entitled "Dual voice" in the NVDA menu to select the secondary voice and setting of the Dual voice.
